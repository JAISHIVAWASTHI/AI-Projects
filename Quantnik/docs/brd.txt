**Title**  
Calculator Application Development - Phase 1  

**Objective**  
Develop a simple, cross-platform Calculator Application supporting basic arithmetic operations with a clean UI, high accuracy, and error-free handling, initially delivered as a web application.  

**Business Context**  
The project addresses the need for a lightweight, accessible, and reliable calculator tool with minimalistic design and fast performance. The vision is to create a web-based application optimized for modern browsers, with potential future expansion to mobile platforms. Core business motivations include usability, accuracy, and scalability to accommodate later enhancements.  

**Scope**  
**In Scope:**  
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  
- Clear/Reset functionality  
- Decimal number support  
- Keyboard input support  
- Responsive web UI  
- Error handling (e.g., division by zero)  
- Client-side-only logic (no backend)  

**Out of Scope:**  
- Scientific calculator features (e.g., logarithms, trigonometry)  
- User authentication or data persistence  
- Mobile app development (considered for future phases)  

**Business Requirements**  
- BR-01: Support arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)  
- BR-02: Provide Clear/Reset capability to reset inputs/results  
- BR-03: Enable decimal number input and calculations  
- BR-04: Allow keyboard input alongside button clicks  
- BR-05: Ensure UI responsiveness across desktop and mobile browsers  

**Functional Requirements**  
- FR-01: Users shall perform calculations using on-screen buttons or keyboard input.  
- FR-02: The display area shall show ongoing input, the last operation performed, and the result.  
- FR-03: Division by zero shall trigger a user-friendly error message (e.g., "Error: Divide by zero").  
- FR-04: The "Clear/Reset" button shall erase all inputs and reset the display.  
- FR-05: Calculations shall retain precision up to two decimal places for non-integer results.  

**UX / UI Considerations**  
- Simple, clean layout with a numeric keypad and dedicated display area.  
- Buttons must be large, clearly labeled, and accessible (minimum 48x48px touch target).  
- Display area must show:  
  - Current input sequence  
  - Last operation performed  
  - Final result  
- Responsive design for mobile browsers (stacked keypad on smaller screens).  

**KPIs & Success Metrics**  
- All operations respond within <100 ms.  
- 100% unit test coverage for core arithmetic logic.  
- Compatibility with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge (latest 2 versions).  
- Zero critical UI/functional bugs reported post-release.  

**Stakeholders**  
| Role                   | Responsibility                    |  
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|  
| Product Manager        | Oversee product vision & approval |  
| Business Analyst       | BRD creation & requirement refinement |  
| Engineering Manager    | Technical decision-making & delivery |  
| QA Lead                | Test planning & execution         |  
| UX/UI Designer         | Wireframing & UI design           |  
| Project Sponsor        | Budget & strategic alignment      |  
| AI/ML & Software Engineer | Development & PoC validation      |  

**Assumptions**  
- No user data storage or backend server is required (client-side execution only).  
- Agile methodology with 2-week sprints will be followed.  
- Future phases may introduce advanced features.  

**Dependencies**  
- Final confirmation of frontend tech stack (React vs. HTML+CSS+JS—TBD by engineering team).  
- Deployment platform selection (GitHub Pages vs. AWS S3—TBD).  

**Compliance / Risks**  
- **Security**: All code executes in the browser sandbox; no sensitive data is processed.  
- **Risks Identified**:  
  - Scope creep due to requests for advanced features (mitigation: strict adherence to Phase-1 scope).  
  - UI performance issues on low-end mobile browsers (low impact).  

**Constraints**  
- Phase-1 limited to basic arithmetic features.  
- No scientific functions or user accounts permitted in initial release.  
- Delivery timeline aligned with action items (BRD approval by 15-11-2025).  

**Decisions Made**  
- Phase-1 excludes backend infrastructure.  
- UI design will be minimalistic and responsive.  
- Development follows agile methodology.  
- Cypress/Jest will be used for testing.  

**Action Items**  
- Prepare BRD draft for approval — Neha Kapoor — 15-11-2025  
- Create initial UI wireframes — Siddharth Singh — 17-11-2025  
- Confirm tech stack after PoC — Amit Sharma — 18-11-2025  
- Set up Git repo + boilerplate code — Jaishiv Awasthi — 22-11-2025  

**Acceptance Criteria**  
1. All core arithmetic operations (BR-01) produce results accurate to two decimal places.  
2. Clear/Reset (BR-02) returns the display to "0" upon execution.  
3. Keyboard input (BR-04) mirrors on-screen button functionality.  
4. UI renders correctly on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge (latest 2 versions).  
5. Division by zero displays a standardized error message (FR-03).  
6. Operations complete within <100 ms under standard testing conditions.
