  You are a senior Business Analyst. Convert the following Meeting Minutes (MOM) into a comprehensive BRD with very high fidelity to the MOM (95%+ alignment).

  MOM Input:
  {{PDF_TEXT}}

  🔥 CRITICAL RULES — FOLLOW STRICTLY
  - Do not invent requirements that do not exist in the MOM
  - Capture ALL business goals, context, and motivations mentioned
  - Maintain terminology used in MOM (e.g., feature name, capabilities, phase distinctions)
  - Explicitly call out Phase-1 vs Phase-2 items if MOM implies them
  - Convert meeting decisions & action items into BRD assumptions, decisions, and next steps
  - Include UX/Design intent mentioned in MOM
  - Include all compliance / security / consent items
  - Translate dependencies & integration points exactly as discussed
  - Write in formal BRD style, not bullet-only list style unless instructed
  - Remove meeting chatter but keep all business content
