# **Character-Level GPT Language Model**

This repository implements a **character-level GPT-style transformer** using PyTorch. The model is trained to generate text character by character, inspired by the transformer architecture described in the [GPT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). 

## **Features**
- Character-level language modeling
- Implements causal self-attention with masking
- Multi-head attention mechanism
- Transformer blocks with residual connections and LayerNorm
- Configurable hyperparameters for flexible training
- Text generation using a trained model

---

## **Project Overview**
The model processes and predicts text at the character level. It can generate coherent text by learning patterns in the input dataset. This implementation is designed for simplicity and extensibility.

### **Key Components**
1. **Transformer Architecture**:
   - Multi-Head Attention
   - FeedForward Neural Networks
   - Positional Embeddings
   - Layer Normalization

2. **Training Pipeline**:
   - Train/Validation Split
   - Cross-Entropy Loss for optimization
   - AdamW optimizer for weight updates

3. **Text Generation**:
   - Predicts character sequences token by token.
   - Supports sampling with context.

---

## **Installation**
1. Download zip file and save on your local filesystem
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch
   ```

---

## **Usage**
### **1. Prepare Dataset**
- Place your text dataset in `./tejas_networks.txt`.

### **2. Training**
Run the training script:
```bash
python gpt.py
```
During training, the model prints training and validation loss at regular intervals.

### **3. Text Generation**
To generate text, modify the context in the script:
```python
context = torch.tensor([encode("your prompt here")], dtype=torch.long, device=device)
print(decode(m.generate(context, max_new_tokens=200)[0].tolist()))
```

## **Code Details**
### **1. Model Architecture**
- **Self-Attention**: Computes token dependencies to capture context.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Parallel attention heads for better representation.
- **FeedForward Network**: Non-linear transformation for feature processing.
- **Positional Embeddings**: Adds position awareness to token embeddings.

### **2. Training**
- **Data Loader**: Splits data into train and validation sets. Generates batches of sequences.
- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss for character prediction.
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with weight decay for efficient training.

### **3. Text Generation**
- Generates text sequentially using causal masking.
- Predicts one character at a time based on prior tokens.
