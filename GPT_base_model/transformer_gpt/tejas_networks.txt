1.3 Off Hours Working
Sometimes on account of the nature of the business, in order to meet project deadlines or
customer requirements, an employee may be delayed at work or may have to come in to work
either on weekdays or weekends at odd hours (between 9.30 P.M and 6.00 A.M). Such
employees are given the option to take a city-taxi either to get back home from office or to
the office from residence. Employees delayed at work, are required to inform security by 6.00
pm as to their likely time of departure. This will help security to plan for taxis and pooling of
resources. The employee needs to pay toward use of city-taxi and claim re-imbursementfrom
the Company by filing an expense report.
If an employee is working in shifts and has to either come to work or get back home from work
during off hours as defined above, the Company would reimburse the cost incurred towards
city-taxi.
If the employee has a need to work on weekends, the employee can request security to
provide for lunch or dinner or could claim re-imbursement up to Rs.75/- per meal with
manager’s approval except NSG 24X7 team.
Lunch & Dinner will be provided over the weekend for 24X7 NSG employees.
1.4 Attendance
On entering the office premises, employees need to swipe their swipe card at the turnstile
installed at the entrance door to record their attendance in HRMS. If an employee forgets the
ID and access card, they are to contact the Administration Team to avail a temporary access
card and visitor ID card for that particular day. The temporary access card entries will be
mapped to the employee’s attendance.
1.5 Security Identification
On the date of joining, employees would receive the access swipe card from Administration
Department. Permanent photo ID card will be provided within a week from the date of
joining. Employees are required to wear the cards and to prominently display them. These
should not be carried in wallets, pockets, etc. On demand, employees would be required to
show ID Cards to Security. In the event it is not produced, security has a right to refuse entry
into the premises. In case of loss of temporary or permanent swipe card and ID card, please
inform the administration department immediately. The employee has to make a payment of
Rs.350/- to the Finance team. A new swipe card and ID card will be issued by the
administration department within 2 working days. The swipe card and ID card belongs to
Tejas and therefore must be returned to the administration department in the event of
employee’s separation. In case the swipe card and ID card is not returned at the time of exit,
the card would be deactivated and Rs.350/- would be deducted from the full and final
settlement of the employee.
